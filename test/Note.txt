--------------------------------------------------
Every Flutter Widget has a built-in lifecycle:
A collection of methods that are automatically executed by Flutter (at certain points of time).

There are three extremely important (stateful) widget lifecycle methods you should be aware of:

initState(): Executed by Flutter when the StatefulWidget's State object is initialized

build(): Executed by Flutter when the Widget is built for the first time AND after setState() was called

dispose(): Executed by Flutter right before the Widget will be deleted (e.g., because it was displayed conditionally)

You will encounter them all multiple times throughout the course - therefore you don't have to memorize them now and you will see them in action. It's still worth learning about them right now already.


###Fist approach of changing state
  Widget ?activeScreen; //? Meaning activeScreen could be null

  void initState(){
    activeScreen = StartScreen(switchScreen);
    super.initState(); //Set initiate state for created object
  }

  void switchScreen(){//switchScreen does not take any  argument
    setState(() {
      activeScreen =const QuestionsScreen();
    });
  }
 .........
 child : activeScreen
##############The second approach of changing state is using string and condition #####

var activeScreen = 'start-screen';


  void switchScreen(){//switchScreen does not take any  argument
    setState(() {
      activeScreen ='question-screen';
    });
  }

child: activeScreen == 'start-screen' ? StartScreen(switchScreen)
              : const QuestionsScreen()

#############The 3rd way of set the state of widget depending on if condition#######
Under build() function, create a variable widget then input to child component of container
 Widget screenWidget = StartScreen(switchScreen);
    if (activeScreen == 'question-screen'){
      screenWidget = QuestionsScreen();
    }

  child: screenWidget
